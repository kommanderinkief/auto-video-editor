00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Greetings. So what are you hoping that this exercise will illustrate?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,680
This transcription sample will give us a idea of your transcription skills, whether

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,000
practice, natural, or burgeoning. Oh, I see. What are these skills?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,280
We're looking for accuracy, even exact hits of content that is spoken, being reliably

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,480
transposed into written form. Yes, transcription has a lot to do with type and speed,

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,760
but that is not all, and it is not as easy as ABC. Sounds interesting, informative,

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,560
and I want to learn more. Can you tell me, certainly? First, you have to be able to

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,560
process the accents, dialect, speak and cadence of individuals in the recording. Sometimes even

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,840
especially at the speaker isn't speaking and totally good grammar. All right, second.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,840
One needs to discern the challenge of content. Sometimes through contextual clues, or just

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,920
connecting to what is going on, and sometimes with the help of outside resources, such

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,760
as those provided, or through internet research. If this statement is made, the non-circum

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,040
substantial evidence will show that a 2003 view of GXL was stolen on the 9th February

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,080
or 8th 2000 in Pocups in New York, taken from the Finston Park parking lot of atmospheric

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,120
farm up to the stern pipe, all the pieces of critical content. In this case, the proper

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,160
nouns have to be accurate in the transcript, just as they should be in this sample exercise.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,360
That is why there's extra time given to you to complete the sample. Even the exact spelling,

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,360
especially the exact spelling, even if you don't know the name return. If an attorney

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,740
said, I'm a Catholicer, and you couldn't understand her, but she also said, meaning

20
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,280
friend of the court, it would be your job to get the term right. Okay, a third ability

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,040
meeting is an ear that can be patient and tolerant, such as when there are multiple speakers

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
talking over one another, or a recording device setting, not functions.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,280
Senate, speakers might find like this. We'll extend it to capture content.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,520
Oh, I see. So there will be some replaying, even posing. Yes, exactly. In our transcription

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,960
work, there are two different main styles. Strict for biota main insurance and clean for

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,960
biota main for legal work. What is the difference if you don't mind me asking? I've

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,520
got a lot of questions all of a sudden, and I sincerely hope that someone like you and

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,120
you're elevated in form position might be able to help me understand what is all about.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,360
So I can do the best job possible with this sample. Sure. Strict for biota is when you

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:36,400
type every word and utter and to speak or makes. So we like a speaker talk, like this,

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,160
even the, is captured in the transcript. This is important in insurance transcription, because

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,160
the transcript use can rely upon how an ant, a statement was given, as well as its content.

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,520
Got it. Just type what you hear. Is it a hyphen for a false start of a word? I assume

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,640
it's followed by a comma, just as you would sit off the up, right? Yes. Now, legal transcription

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,720
on the other hand is a formal representation of what happened in a preceding and relies

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,760
upon the clarity of the facts unimpeded by the speaker articulation. Very good to excellent

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,960
use of the English language is needed, including grammar and punctuation. If you don't

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,560
have a reliable foundation, you'll want to develop one, and there are lots of free online

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,360
websites that can help. We suggest grammarmonster.com and jumpcom.com as two good resources.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,240
So on this sample, are you going to look at all this stuff? We sure are. Now, you don't

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,840
have to be absolutely perfect, but we do look for candidates who show that they understand

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,600
what is expected. I wish you good luck. Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:04:09,920
my best. Thank you.
