Hello. Greetings. So what are you hoping that this exercise will illustrate?

00:06.000 --> 00:10.680
This transcription sample will give us a idea of your transcription skills, whether

00:10.680 --> 00:15.000
practice, natural, or burgeoning. Oh, I see. What are these skills?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.280
We're looking for accuracy, even exact hits of content that is spoken, being reliably

00:20.280 --> 00:25.480
transposed into written form. Yes, transcription has a lot to do with type and speed,

00:25.480 --> 00:30.760
but that is not all, and it is not as easy as ABC. Sounds interesting, informative,

00:30.760 --> 00:35.560
and I want to learn more. Can you tell me, certainly? First, you have to be able to

00:35.560 --> 00:41.560
process the accents, dialect, speak and cadence of individuals in the recording. Sometimes even

00:41.560 --> 00:46.840
especially at the speaker isn't speaking and totally good grammar. All right, second.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.840
One needs to discern the challenge of content. Sometimes through contextual clues, or just

00:51.840 --> 00:56.920
connecting to what is going on, and sometimes with the help of outside resources, such

00:56.920 --> 01:02.760
as those provided, or through internet research. If this statement is made, the non-circum

01:02.760 --> 01:08.040
substantial evidence will show that a 2003 view of GXL was stolen on the 9th February

01:08.040 --> 01:14.080
or 8th 2000 in Pocups in New York, taken from the Finston Park parking lot of atmospheric

01:14.080 --> 01:20.120
farm up to the stern pipe, all the pieces of critical content. In this case, the proper

01:20.120 --> 01:26.160
nouns have to be accurate in the transcript, just as they should be in this sample exercise.

01:26.160 --> 01:31.360
That is why there's extra time given to you to complete the sample. Even the exact spelling,

01:31.360 --> 01:36.360
especially the exact spelling, even if you don't know the name return. If an attorney

01:36.360 --> 01:40.740
said, I'm a Catholicer, and you couldn't understand her, but she also said, meaning

01:40.740 --> 01:46.280
friend of the court, it would be your job to get the term right. Okay, a third ability

01:46.280 --> 01:51.040
meeting is an ear that can be patient and tolerant, such as when there are multiple speakers

01:51.040 --> 01:55.040
talking over one another, or a recording device setting, not functions.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.280
Senate, speakers might find like this. We'll extend it to capture content.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.520
Oh, I see. So there will be some replaying, even posing. Yes, exactly. In our transcription

02:06.520 --> 02:10.960
work, there are two different main styles. Strict for biota main insurance and clean for

02:10.960 --> 02:14.960
biota main for legal work. What is the difference if you don't mind me asking? I've

02:14.960 --> 02:18.520
got a lot of questions all of a sudden, and I sincerely hope that someone like you and

02:18.520 --> 02:23.120
you're elevated in form position might be able to help me understand what is all about.

02:23.120 --> 02:28.360
So I can do the best job possible with this sample. Sure. Strict for biota is when you

02:28.360 --> 02:36.400
type every word and utter and to speak or makes. So we like a speaker talk, like this,

02:36.400 --> 02:42.160
even the, is captured in the transcript. This is important in insurance transcription, because

02:42.160 --> 02:49.160
the transcript use can rely upon how an ant, a statement was given, as well as its content.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.520
Got it. Just type what you hear. Is it a hyphen for a false start of a word? I assume

02:54.520 --> 03:00.640
it's followed by a comma, just as you would sit off the up, right? Yes. Now, legal transcription

03:00.640 --> 03:05.720
on the other hand is a formal representation of what happened in a preceding and relies

03:05.720 --> 03:11.760
upon the clarity of the facts unimpeded by the speaker articulation. Very good to excellent

03:11.760 --> 03:16.960
use of the English language is needed, including grammar and punctuation. If you don't

03:16.960 --> 03:21.560
have a reliable foundation, you'll want to develop one, and there are lots of free online

03:21.560 --> 03:29.360
websites that can help. We suggest grammarmonster.com and jumpcom.com as two good resources.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.240
So on this sample, are you going to look at all this stuff? We sure are. Now, you don't

03:34.240 --> 03:38.840
have to be absolutely perfect, but we do look for candidates who show that they understand

03:38.840 --> 03:43.600
what is expected. I wish you good luck. Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do

03:43.600 --> 04:09.920
my best. Thank you.
